      "- Vicunas: Llamas share evolutionary roots with vicuñas. Both llamas and vicuñas have been domesticated for their wool, which is known to be warm yet lightweight—ideal in high altitude regions where these animals are native such as the Andes mountains of South America.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- Camels: Llamas share a closer genetic link with camels compared to other wild or semi-domesticated relatives like guanacos and alpaca, which belong to different subfamilies within the broader superfamily Artiodactyla (even-toed ungulates). True Camelus species—dromedaries found in North Africa/Middle East regions and Bactrian camels native from Central Asia – have diverged significantly over time. Nevertheless, llamas still share certain morphological features like their long necks, humps on the shoulders for carrying heavy loads (though not as prominent), split hooves adapted to tough terrains such as deserts or rocky mountains where they were domesticated thousands of years ago by indigenous peoplaus.\n",
      "  \n",

This relationship demonstrates a rich history of domestication and adaptation for specific ecological niches.\n"
