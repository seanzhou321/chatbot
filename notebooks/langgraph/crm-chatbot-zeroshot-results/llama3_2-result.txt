Hi there, what time is my flight?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

I'm sorry, but I don't have the capability to check your flight information. You might want to use the airline's app or website for that information. Can you provide more details so I can assist better? For example, do you need help with checking in for your flight or would you like me to search for your flight based on a specific booking reference?
================================ Human Message =================================

Am i allowed to update my flight to something sooner? I want to leave later today.
================================== Ai Message ==================================

It seems like you're asking about updating a flight, but the available functions provided do not include any for managing or updating flights. The functions listed are related to hotels and trip recommendations. Could you please clarify if you're looking to book, update, cancel, or search for something specific using these services? If it's related to flights, could you provide more details so I can assist better?
================================ Human Message =================================

Update my flight to sometime next week then
================================== Ai Message ==================================

I see you want to update your flight booking. However, the available functions do not include an option for updating flights directly. Could you please provide more details such as the ID of the flight reservation and the new dates? If it's about another type of booking (e.g., hotel or excursion), could you specify that as well?

If you indeed need to update a flight and these options aren't available, we might need to look into other means or tools for handling this request. Could you clarify your requirements further?
================================ Human Message =================================

The next available option is great
================================== Ai Message ==================================

It seems like you've selected an option without providing specific details about what exactly you're referring to (e.g., hotel booking, trip recommendation). Could you please clarify so I can assist you further? If it's a hotel or excursion that was previously searched and you'd like to proceed with the next available option, could you provide me with the ID or additional context?
================================ Human Message =================================

what about lodging and transportation?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

It seems like you're interested in knowing more about the options for lodging and transportation. Could you please specify what kind of information you are looking for? For example, do you want to search for hotels or book accommodations? Or are you seeking details on how to arrange transportation during your trip? Please provide more context so I can assist you better.
================================ Human Message =================================

================================== Ai Message ==================================

It seems like there was an error because I tried to use a non-existent function `search_rental_cars`. Instead, we can use the available functions to achieve similar goals. For example, if you want to search for car rentals, you could use the `search_car_rentals` function.

If you would like to proceed with searching for car rentals or any other specific task related to travel arrangements, please provide more details so I can assist you accordingly.

Cool so now what recommendations do you have on excursions?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To provide you with excursion recommendations, I need some more details such as the location or any specific keywords that interest you. Could you please specify a location or give me some ideas about what kind of activities you're interested in?

If you don't have any particular preferences right now, I can still fetch some popular options from various locations. Let me know how you'd like to proceed!

Name: search_trip_recommendations

Error: OperationalError('no such table: trip_recommendations')
 Please fix your mistakes.
================================== Ai Message ==================================

It seems there's an issue with the database as the `trip_recommendations` table does not exist. This error could occur if the script that sets up or migrates the database hasn't been run, or if there was a problem during setup.

To resolve this:

1. Ensure you have the correct schema for your database.
2. Run any necessary migration scripts to create missing tables.
3. Verify that your connection string (`db`) is pointing to the right database where these tables should exist.

If you're unsure how to proceed, please provide more context about your setup or ask specific questions regarding setting up and managing your database schema.

OK great pick one and book it for my second day there.
================================== Ai Message ==================================

It seems like you want to book an excursion or a hotel, but you didn't specify which one or provide enough details such as the ID of the recommendation or hotel. Could you please clarify? For example, if you're booking an excursion, I would need the `recommendation_id` and for a hotel, I would need the `hotel_id`.
