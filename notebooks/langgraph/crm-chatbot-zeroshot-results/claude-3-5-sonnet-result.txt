- Your ticket number starts with 724 (SWISS ticket)
- It's not paid for by barter or voucher
- It's an active flight booking (not open ticket or ticket without flight segments) 
- It's a one-way or return ticket with a single flight route
- It doesn't contain segments with other airlines
- It's not part of a group booking
- The origin and destination are not changed

If your booking meets those requirements, then I can proceed with trying to update your flight to an earlier time today using the `update_ticket_to_new_flight` tool.
